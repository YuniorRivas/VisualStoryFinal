            <p class="section-description">
                Fentanyl is a  synthetic opioid that is 50 to 100 times more potent than heroin. 
                It is a prescription pain medication that is also made and distrbuted illegally. While fentanyl is used medical settings to treat severe pain, it is a controlled substance due to its highly addictive properties. Fentanyl is often mixed with other illicti drugs, unknown to many users, and carries a extreme risk of overdose and death. It is currently the deadliest drug in the United States.

            <p class="section-description">
                Over 3,000 people died from drug overdose in New York City in 2022, a 12 percent increase from 2021.

<p class="section-description">
Deaths by drug overdose kill more New Yorkers than accidental falls, motor vehicle accidents, and fires combined. Recently released data by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene indicates that fentanyl was present in at least 81 percent of drug overdose deaths in 2022.
 </p>

<p class="section-description">
Health Commissioner Dr. Ashwin Vasan issued an advisory as the 2022 data on Unintentional Drug Poisonings was presented. “This crisis is killing a New Yorker every three hours and is impacting every individual and family in our city and in our nation,” proclaimed Dr. Vasan. “No one is spared, even if you think otherwise.”
            </p>

        <p class="section-description">

The city and state have launched a comprehensive Fentanyl Awareness Campaign designed to educate New Yorkers about the dangers of fentanyl and offers advice on preventing overdoses, such as the importance of not using drugs alone, the dangers of mixing drugs, and the life saving potential of carrying naloxone, an opioid overdose reversal medication. All those who request naloxone from any pharamacy can receive it for free. Furthermore, naloxone traning senimars are held across the city routinely.
